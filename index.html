Alexander Sergeevich, although he has never been to Tomsk, left a considerable mark in the hearts of everyone who has ever lived here. Tomsk's "land", the student world on the map of Russia, Siberian Petersburg, always remembers Onegin and Dubrovsky, Lensky and Troekurov, as well as many others. Among Pushkin's associates, some were directly connected with our city. Alexey Illichevsky, a friend from the Tsarskoye Selo lyceum, was a son of the governer of Tomsk. During his school years his own poetic sketches were rated even higher than Alexander Sergeevich's. Remember these lines? The poet's best friend, Ivan Pushchin, was passing those areas several times. He visited the Decembrist Gabriel Bat'enkov, who lived in the Blagoveshchensky lane. Now it is named after him.
